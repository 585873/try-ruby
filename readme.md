# Try Ruby

Please complete the first 3 levels of Try Ruby - http://tryruby.org/

## Deliverables

Please open an issue on this repository, and choose one programming concept to discuss, 
including but not limited to:

- conditionals
- truthy/falsey
- for loops
- functions/methods
- complex data types

and compare and contrast their JavaScript and Ruby implementations.

For example:

### Truthy/Falsey

In JavaScript, 0 is a falsey value, but 0 is a truthy value in Ruby.

```rb
# ruby
number = 0
if number
  puts "0 is truthy"
end
```

```js
// javascript
number = 0
if(!number){
  console.log("0 is falsey)"
}
```
